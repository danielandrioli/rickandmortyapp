This is an app that uses rickandmortyapi.com API to show Rick & Morty characters. 
I love this series, and I thought it would be cool to create an app using this API. 
The user can search for any character they want, filter by gender/status, and click on it to see its full detail fragment. 
My main objective was just to practice the use of some libraries, like Retrofit and Paging3, so things like layout weren't the focus of this app.
Different than my previous app, in this one I didn't use Room.
